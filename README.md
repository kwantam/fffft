Parallel FFT computation for [ff::Field] types via [rayon].

Implementing the trait for other [ff::Field] types is very simple:
define a constant `S` and a function `root_of_unity()` that returns a
field element that is a 2^`S`th primitive roof of unity.
This crate contains a blanket trait impl for [ff::PrimeField].
